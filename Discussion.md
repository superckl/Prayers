### Needed Textures

- General Prayer icon
- Bone items
- Holy water fluid
- Holy water bucket and bottle
- Protext from magic, melee, and ranged icons (16x16?)
- Background for overhead prayers
- Basic altar model
- Potion booster prayer icon
- Four levels of melee strength boosting prayers
- Four levels of projectile strength boosting prayers
- Protect items prayer
- Banner
- Prayer boost, restore, and instant restore potions (level I and II)

### Planned Features

- Altar boosting blocks (increase altar power if placed near)
- A way to brew the new potions. Adding them to vanilla stand isn't feasible.
- More prayers
- Unlockable prayers
- Tier 2 altar

### Ideas and Theory

- Mobs that use prayers
- Curses/alternate prayer books
- New dimesnions (Olympia-esque?)
